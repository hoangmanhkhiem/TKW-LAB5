    <p>Skeleton-based action recognition has been studied extensively in recent years. Here, we only review the works
        related to our approach. Conventional methods for skeletonbased action recognition usually design handcrafted features
        to model the human body [6], [7]. For example, Vemulapalli et
        al. [6] encode the skeletons with their rotations and translations
        in a Lie group. Fernando et al. [7] use the rank pooling method
        to represent the data with the parameters of the ranker.

    <p>With the development of the deep learning, data-driven
        methods have become the mainstream methods, where the
        most widely used models are RNNs and CNNs. RNN-based
        methods usually model the skeleton data as a sequence of
        the coordinate vectors along both the spatial and temporal
        dimensions, where each of the vectors represents a human
        body joint [8], [11], [12], [14], [36]. Du et al. [8] use a
        hierarchical bidirectional RNN model to identify the skeleton
        sequence, which divides the human body into different parts
        and sends them to different sub-networks. Song et al. [11]
        embed a spatiotemporal attention module in LSTM-based
        model, so that the network can automatically pay attention
        to the discriminant spatiotemporal region of the skeleton
        sequence
